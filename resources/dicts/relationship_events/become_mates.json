		"m_c and r_c have been practically floating on air since announcing their commitment as mates before c_n.",
		"Some of the less sympathetic cats of c_n try and hack up a hairball, rather than watch m_c and r_c melt in each others' direction. New mates can be insufferable.",
		"The more romantic members of the Clan sigh, watching the new mates m_c and r_c, who're too caught up in each other to notice.",

		"Their love has been a slow basking warmth, not a wildfire, and m_c wouldn't change it for the world. {PRONOUN/m_c/subject/CAP}{VERB/m_c/'re/'s} so excited to commit to padding at r_c's side forever.",

		"After traveling outside familiar territories, m_c approached r_c, a rare and beautiful flower dangling from {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} mouth. Despite being blanketed with dirt and muck on {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} coat, when {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} confessed {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} love, r_c launched {PRONOUN/r_c/self} forward with a solid yes!"

		"No one is going to blame m_c for the pride {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} display in succcessfully asking r_c to become {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} mate. It's a wonderful life event to celebrate, and something to rightfully congratulate the couple on.",
		"Truth be told, while a spark is evident between m_c and r_c, it's no large wildfire-- more like a humble flicker. However, there was no better honour than to expend and gain respect from their Clan. And so, the two have become mates.",
		"Throughout their days together, m_c and r_c have expressed similar thoughts; who are they, in a romantic sense? Romance is a tricky subject, and neither quite fully understands it. But they've seen their Clanmates pairing up, and, to see what all the fuss is about it, the two have agreed to become mates",

Initially, it was just friendship, but as time passed, blushing and throbbing hearts became too common and overwhelming, prompting them to become mates.",
		"Like a singular spark, m_c and r_c never anticipated that their connection would scorch and become a wildfire. The stinging burns were felt by m_c, and {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} could tell r_c felt them too. Not wanting to be consumed by their raging longing, the two leaped into the flames and became mates."

When the moment came, however, it was all for naught, as r_c calmly, yet with a sting of sadness, did not reciprocate the feelings. Nonetheless, {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} hopes their friendship can be mended.",
		"It was well known that m_c and r_c synchronized with each other so well that even their Clanmates thought they were mates. m_c loved this idea, thinking who better to be both a best friend and a mate. However, when the topic came up over prey, r_c, after mulling it over, decided to end the conversation with a refusal, preferring to remain just friends. For now, at least.",
		"m_c and r_c made such a perfect couple, or so m_c told {PRONOUN/m_c/self} repeatedly as if it were the truth. However, this was far from reality. So, when {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} tried to serenade {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} love for r_c, it was no surprise that r_c bluntly refused. However, as m_c's fiery temper took over, it took the entire Clan to separate the two after m_c accused {PRONOUN/r_c/object} of being in an imaginary affair."
