        "Crawling around gets boring quickly. You have such tiny little legs... And nowhere to be. Time for another nap?",
        "You've managed three more steps since the day before! Wait... Do you know how to count?",
        "There's a lot of things you've never seen before here. Part of you wonders if you would have discovered it in time had you lived.",
        "Listening to the murmurs of other cats is a good way to learn. Each day brings new information to your tiny ears.",
        "This may not be the Starclan you wanted, but despite its empty space, the warmth you feel outmatches the dreams of stars.",
        "You blink your tiny eyes open when you're enveloped in warmth. The glint of stars surrounds you. But just as soon as it came, the feeling disappears again. ",
        "Something drips onto your back. Glancing up with your tiny eyes, you see a dark figure looming, dripping with something. You give a squeak of fear before the thing disappears as quietly as it came.",
        "As tiny as you are it's a good thing nothing can hurt you now. You'd have been stepped on all the time if not!"
