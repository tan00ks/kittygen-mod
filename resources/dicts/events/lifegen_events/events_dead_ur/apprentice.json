        "You remember when you visited StarClan when you were six moons old. The experience is still so fresh in your mind. Why are you not there now?",
        "One day you realize you will never grow older. The thought strikes you hard, and you spend a while pondering that fact. ",
        "Today is your assessment! Or at least, you've decided it is. You go through the motions and decide it was a job well done! Now if only you could have your ceremony... For now you'll brainstorm what your name could have been.",
        "Watching training, you end up in the fray on accident. When an apprentice swipes a paw through you they seem to notice you - at least a little bit. When they move away you can hear them commenting on an odd feeling. Their mentor tells them to rest. Oops!",
        "Getting into mischief is something apprentices do. So when you see a few attempting to sneak out, you follow along to make sure nothing happens. It's actually a lot of fun even if they can't see you!"
