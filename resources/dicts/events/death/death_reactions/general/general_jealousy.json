      "Jealousy is a term better suited for kits; whether it's being disappointingly weak at mossball while others excel, someone receiving your favorite prey as a gift, or being hailed as the greatest cat ever when no one truly cares about them. But none of these things applied to r_c. It wasn't about m_c being a little too skilled at certain things. After all, perfection is a myth, so why shouldn't {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} highlight m_c's flaws and mistakes at {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} vigil?"

For moons, m_c had been showered with praise and love by all, while r_c received barely any, despite both pledging loyalty to their Clan. {PRONOUN/r_c/subject/CAP} guesses for m_c, it just mattered more. Hopefully, with m_c's body not found and no vigil to be held, genuine attention and love can now be directed towards others."
