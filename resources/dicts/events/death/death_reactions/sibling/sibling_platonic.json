Even though r_c could see cats circling {PRONOUN/r_c/object}, shock, arguing, and sobbing, everything was muted; in term of colors and voices. And, it became worse when {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} legs nearly gave out and crumble from {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} weighted heart, though thankfully someone caught {PRONOUN/r_c/object}. m_c was like another part of {PRONOUN/r_c/object}, and now, without {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} sibling to enjoy another sunset together, r_c could only weep at the vigil.",

But it's even harder when that Clanmate was a sibling. r_c never knew {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} had to learn this so soon, realizing m_c belonged to StarClan now. Having to lick m_c for the last time, r_c choked back tears and screams as {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} sunk {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} claws into the dirt, burying m_c."

However, as days crept by, r_c's heart sunk when the truth revealed itself; m_c is gone.",

Or, possibly playing another prank, though this time {PRONOUN/m_c/subject} would have a hefty paw to the muzzle. m_c wouldn't just... disappeared from this world. {PRONOUN/r_c/subject/CAP} didn't wanted to hear it, but {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} Clanmates had to tell {PRONOUN/r_c/object} otherwise to not starve {PRONOUN/r_c/self} waiting for someone that will never come back."
