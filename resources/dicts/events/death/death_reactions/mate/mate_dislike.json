      "Driven by empathy and sorrow, Clanmates reach out to r_c, offering prey and a noble shoulder to cry on after the vigil for m_c. However, r_c simply turns down every gesture of sympathy; death comes for everyone, and it took its sweet time for m_c.",
      "r_c holds m_c in {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} paws during the vigil, weeping burning tears onto the cold, limp body. Even if things have soured throughout their lives, and r_c wants nothing more but to hiss at {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} dumb mate, deep down, {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} misses m_c.",

      "At the end of the vigil, after the tears are shed and the mourning sweeps through the Clan, r_c drags {PRONOUN/r_c/self} straight into {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} nest. m_c and r_c once share this nest, but now it's all {PRONOUN/r_c/poss}. Despite only resurfacing horrible memories between the two, the nest feels... empty.",

And, with no body found to hold a vigil, {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} doesn't need to weep, only to celebrate."
